# Cadence

A simple metronome app for runners built with Flutter.

## About

Cadence helps you maintain a consistent step rate by providing an audible beat to match your stride rhythm. This can improve efficiency, reduce injury risk, and enhance endurance.

## Features

- Adjustable BPM (beats per minute)
- Simple, clean interface  (it's just a number and some buttons - we're not launching rockets here)
- No ads, no tracking, no permissions (just you, the beat, and questionable life choices at 6 AM)
- Free forever (because charging for beeps feels morally wrong)
